            <li><strong>Technical information</strong> – such as device type, operating system, and usage logs, which may be used for debugging and improving the App.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. How We Use Your Information</h3>
        <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>

            <li><strong>Future features (optional):</strong> We may use anonymized and aggregated data across all users to provide insights and benchmarking, such as comparing expense-to-income ratios across different income ranges. This aggregated data will never personally identify you.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. How We Share Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>We do not sell or rent your data</strong> to advertisers or third parties.</li>
